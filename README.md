# bash_additions
Additions for bash - aliases and functions which can come in handy

## Installation
Clone this repo into your home directory using HTTPS... 
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/lisawolderiksenSSB/bash_additions.git 
```
...or using SSH 
```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:lisawolderiksenSSB/bash_additions.git 
```

Include the bash_additions file in your `~/.bash_profile` so the aliases and functions are available in *new* terminals/shell windows by adding the following line to `~/.bash_profile`: 
```bash 
source ~/bash_additions/bash_additions 
```

To use the aliases and functions in the *current* terminal/shell, run the same command in the terminal/shell: 
```bash 
source ~/bash_additions/bash_additions 
```
